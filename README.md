This code has been developed as a demo of skills.

This code integrates with REST api developed in Spring boot at "http://localhost:8080/api" when running on local. Following functionalities are supported by this frontend at this moment.

1. Addition of new Match
2. Updating score of a running match
3. Updating status of a running match
4. Display of all the running matches
5. Display of all the finished matches based on the total score and their start time.
6. Deletion of a finished match (if required)

This application does not perform any content validation or perform any security check. The same can be applied within enough time. In the ideal scenarion, the admin page where addition, updating of score, and changing match status will be controlled by the administrator account and two separate pages live matches and match summary will be available to general public who wants those details.
